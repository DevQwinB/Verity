/**
 * PRD §10 hard requirement: every verdict display must state how it was
 * reached, and never imply a guarantee this deployment cannot back. Three
 * things are kept apart here, all driven by what the contract recorded:
 *
 *  - a bonded re-execution consensus (economic, not cryptographic);
 *  - a window that simply elapsed — the work was never replayed to quorum,
 *    so it is not shown in the same green as work that was;
 *  - a ZK proof (Phase 2; the contract accepts none today, so this cannot
 *    occur, but the label follows the real field rather than assuming).
