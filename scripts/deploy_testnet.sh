# Deploys a fresh EscrowGate and ZKVerifierRegistry to Stellar testnet and
# records them in deployments/<name>.json. Each contract is deployed and
# configured in one transaction (constructor args), so there is never a
# deployed-but-unclaimed contract somebody else could initialise.
#
# This always creates NEW contracts — EscrowGate has no upgrade entrypoint —
# so it refuses to replace an existing deployment record unless --force is
# given. After a redeploy the re-executors must be staked and approved again
# (scripts/bootstrap_reexecutors.sh) and the database reset.

#   --public            mark the deployment as one real users are on; the dev
#                       runner and smoke test will refuse to touch it
#   --force             replace an existing deployments/<name>.json
#   VERITY_GATE_CONFIG  full EscrowGate ConfigRecord JSON, to override defaults
#
# Network calls in this repo's dev sandbox require disabling the default
